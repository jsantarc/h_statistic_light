# h_statistic_light

`h_statistic_light` is a lightweight Python implementation of the H-statistic, a metric used to quantify the interaction strength between features in machine learning models. This tool is particularly useful for interpreting complex models by identifying and measuring feature interactions.

## Features

- Efficient computation of the H-statistic for feature interaction analysis.
- Designed for integration with popular machine learning libraries like scikit-learn.
- Minimal dependencies to ensure ease of use and integration.
